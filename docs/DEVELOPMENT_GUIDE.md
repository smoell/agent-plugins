# Development Guide

This project uses Mise (https://mise.jdx.dev/). At the moment, there is no dedicated development container, thus you need to configure your local development environment following the steps described below.

## Pre-requisites

- [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) >= 2026.2.4

## Preparing your Build Environment

| Open the [repository](https://github.com/awslabs/agent-plugins).             | As you are reading this file from the repo, you are probably already there.                                                                                                                                        |
| Using the "fork" button in the upper right, fork the repo into your account. | Some git/GitHub expertise is assumed.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Clone forked repo to your local development environment.                     | If you wish to work off a branch in your repository, create and clone that branch. You will create a PR back to `main` in the agent-plugins repository eventually, you can do that from fork/main or fork/_branch_ |
| `cd agent-plugins`                                                           | This is the home directory of the repo and where you will open your text editor, run builds, etc.                                                                                                                  |

## Claude Code Setup

This project uses Claude Code plugins for development workflows. The project-level `.claude/settings.json` pre-configures enabled plugins via `enabledPlugins`, but you must first register the marketplace(s) it references.

### One-time marketplace setup

Run this once inside a Claude Code session:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add awslabs/agent-plugins
```

After adding the marketplace, the plugins listed in `.claude/settings.json` will activate automatically for this project.

### PR contributor statement

The project-level `attribution.pr` setting automatically appends the required contributor statement to pull request descriptions created by Claude Code, so the `contributorStatement` CI check passes without manual copy-paste.

## Codex Setup

This project also includes Codex plugin packaging for local marketplace-based
testing. The repository provides a Codex marketplace at
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and Codex plugin manifests at
`plugins/*/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

### One-time marketplace setup

Open the repository in Codex so it can discover the repo-local marketplace, then
restart Codex if the marketplace does not appear immediately.

After restart, the `Agent Plugins for AWS` marketplace should appear in the
plugin picker and you can install any of the local AWS plugins from there.

### Regenerating Codex manifests

If you update Claude plugin manifests or marketplace metadata, regenerate the
Codex files with:

```bash
python3 tools/generate_codex_manifests.py
```

This keeps the Codex marketplace and per-plugin Codex manifests aligned with the
Claude source manifests.

## Security Scanning

### Gitleaks - Secret Detection

This repository uses [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) to detect secrets and sensitive information in the codebase.

#### Handling False Positives

If gitleaks reports a false positive (e.g., example API keys in documentation, test fixtures), you can add it to the baseline file to suppress future warnings.

1. Run gitleaks locally to generate the baseline:

   ```bash
   gitleaks git --config=.gitleaks.toml --report-format=json . > .gitleaks-baseline.json
   ```

2. Review the generated file to ensure only legitimate false positives are included.

3. Commit the updated `.gitleaks-baseline.json` file.

#### Configuration

Custom rules and allowlists are defined in `.gitleaks.toml`. Common customizations include:

- Excluding paths (vendor directories, generated files)
- Allowlisting specific patterns or files
- Adding custom secret detection rules
